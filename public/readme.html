      <h2>Automagic Spade</h2>
      <p>The Automagic Spade will update automatically as your status in the Garden progresses. Once you install the dynamic spade in your signature it will progress from seedling to diamond based upon the intervals set by the Garden Club rules and the date you entered the Garden.</p>
      <h4>How to use</h4>
      <p>Using the spade is very easy, however, before we move forward you will need to know the date of your last hard pull.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the date of your last hard pull in YYYYMMDD format.  For example, the date July 15th, 2018 would be written 20180715.  If the month or day is a single digit, you <em>must</em> preface the number with a zero.</li>
        <li>Replace <code>LAST_HP_DATE</code> in the below code with the result of the last step.<br><code>&lt;img src="http://mfgarden.club/spade_image/LAST_HP_DATE" border="0" title="Garden Club Spade" align="right"&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Insert the code from above into your signature.<br>HINT: If you put this code at the top of your signature it <em>usually</em> resolved alignment issues.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Spade Countdown Chart</h2>
      <p>The Spade Countdown Chart will show how many days remain until you reach the next spade. In the event that you've reach Diamond status, the chart will change to show how long you held that coveted position.</p>
      <h4>How to use</h4>
      <p>Using the chart, much like the Automagic Spade, is very easy, however, before we move forward you will need to know the date of your last hard pull.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the date of your last hard pull in YYYYMMDD format.  For example, the date July 15th, 2018 would be written 20180715.  If the month or day is a single digit, you <em>must</em> preface the number with a zero.</li>
        <li>Replace <code>LAST_HP_DATE</code> in the below code with the result of the last step.<br><code>&lt;img src="http://mfgarden.club/spade_countdown_chart/LAST_HP_DATE" title="graph of days until next spade"&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Insert the code from above into your signature.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Garden Club Goal Chart</h2>
      <p>You've made it this far, how about we go for broke? The Garden Club Goal Chart will show how many days remain until you achieve your Garden Club goal. Obviously, if your goal is a certain score or credit limit this isn't going to help, however, if your goal is a date we can have some fun. Once the goal date is reached, the chart will change to show how many days since your goal was reached.</p>
      <h4>How to use</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the date you started gardening, likely the date of your last hard pull, and your goal date in YYYYMMDD format.  For example, the date July 15th, 2018 would be written 20180715.  If the month or day is a single digit, you <em>must</em> preface the number with a zero.</li>
        <li>Replace <code>GARDEN_START_DATE</code> and <code>GARDEN_GOAL_DATE</code>in the below code with the dates from the last step.<br><code>&lt;img src=&quot;http://mfgarden.club/garden_goal_chart/GARDEN_START_DATE/GARDEN_GOAL_DATE&quot; title=&quot;Garden Goal Chart&quot;&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Insert the code from above into your signature.</li>
      </ol>
